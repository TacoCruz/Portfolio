"""
Everything that appears on the portfolio site lives in this file.

    Edit this file  ->  run  python build.py  ->  commit and push

That regenerates index.html and assistant-config.js for you. You never need to
open either of those files; they are build output.

A few conventions used below:

  * Fields whose name ends in _HTML may contain HTML tags, because the text
    needs them (for example <strong> to bold a few words, or <br> to force a
    line break). Everything else is plain text and is escaped automatically,
    so apostrophes, ampersands and quotes are always safe to type.
  * Dates and certificate codes are plain strings; nothing parses them.
  * To add something to a list, copy the last entry, paste it below, and edit
    the values. Trailing commas are fine and encouraged.

POSITIONING: Focused on the security and governance of agentic systems and RAG pipelines. Five years managing large-scale production for banking, real estate, retail, and recreational clients as a technical designer built the critical, deadline-driven thinking now applied to RAG applications and agentic systems.

CREDENTIALS (11 total):
- IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate (IBM Skills Network via Coursera, awarded Aug 20 2026, code RT4C10Z9PPED) — ten courses.
- Certificate in Cybersecurity Proficiency (Concordia University, Continuing Education, Montreal, Jun 30 2026).
Courses within the IBM certificate: Develop Generative AI Applications: Get Started (Apr 8 2026, 6957R7CTBQ8L); Build RAG Applications: Get Started (Apr 16 2026, KLGI2BQ5XCW3); Vector Databases for RAG: An Introduction (Apr 21 2026, 6JFJTO1O844Y); Advanced RAG with Vector Databases and Retrievers (May 4 2026, LNYDTW3UTZF5); Build Multimodal Generative AI Applications (May 11 2026, DX6GNES9TKKB); Fundamentals of Building AI Agents (May 18 2026, 6QE81J6KXN0O); Agentic AI with LangChain and LangGraph (May 25 2026, MD2EC0CGX3WP); Agentic AI with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen and BeeAI (Jun 10 2026, 87PY5FGJOJ5C); Build AI Agents using MCP (Jul 28 2026, OYADP9GDQPDE).

CERTIFIED CAPABILITIES (IBM attestation): design effective prompts and implement function calling; orchestrate complex reasoning workflows with tools like LangChain; build autonomous and collaborative agents using memory, feedback and chaining; integrate APIs, tools and multi-step reasoning into flexible systems; design multi-agent architectures with CrewAI and LangGraph; build retrieval pipelines on vector databases and retrievers.

STACK: LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, BeeAI, MCP, vector databases and retrievers, RAG pipelines, Python.

CODING LANGUAGES: mainly Python, some experience with JSON and JavaScript.

CYBERSECURITY: network and system security, threat and vulnerability assessment, cryptography, access control, incident response, governance and risk — applied to threat modelling, data handling and access control for retrieval and agent systems that touch production data.

CONTACT: danielcruzcastro30@gmail.com · linkedin.com/in/daniel-cruz-0bab18224. All Coursera codes resolve at coursera.org/verify.

FORMAT: reply in plain prose sentences only. Never use markdown syntax — no asterisks for bold or italics, no headings, no hyphen or bullet lists, no code fences. Keep answers under about 60 words.

Work experience achievements: At Montreal Neon Signs Daniel assumed end-to-end oversight of the company's client technical database, ensuring the accurate development and maintenance of production documentation systems; he also led a team of 2 drafters to meet high-volume production deadlines and maintain large-scale client project files, while designing structural systems and anchoring solutions for large-format signage installations. He also managed material budgets and cross-team collaboration with production and installation across multiple concurrent projects, and developed 2D technical drawings and 3D models for engineering approval and municipal permitting, ensuring structural safety and code compliance for signage installation processes.""",
